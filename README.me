## 📖 Overview

This project showcases a chatbot capable of processing user queries, understanding their intent, and delivering appropriate responses. It leverages the power of the InstructorEmbedding model, which is known for generating precise text embeddings tailored to specific tasks and domains.

## ⭐ Features

- **InstructorEmbedding Integration**: Utilizes the InstructorEmbedding model to generate embeddings for intents and responses.
- **Intuitive Matching**: During inference, the chatbot computes embeddings for user questions and pairs them with the most relevant intent from the dataset.
- **Easy Setup**: Streamlined installation and setup process.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Pip
- UMAP
- InstructorEmbedding

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

git clone https://github.com/Arameair/InstructorChatbot.git
cd chatbotProject

2. **Install Dependencies**:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## 💡 Usage

### Training

Train the chatbot on your dataset. By default, it utilizes the `assistant.csv` dataset.

Execute the training script:

python train.py

This will compute embeddings for each dataset entry and store them under the `data/models` directory.

### Inference

Engage in a conversation with the chatbot:

python inference.py

Pose your queries, and the chatbot will retort. Conclude the chat by typing `exit` or `bye`.

> **Note**: Make sure you've trained the model before attempting inference.
